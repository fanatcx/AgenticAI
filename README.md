# Agentic AI 🧠

A lengthy @Boot.dev project that builds an **AI agent** capable of reading, updating, and running code using the **Google Gemini API** and **Python**.

This project explores:
- Tool use (read, write, execute)
- Reasoning loops
- AI-driven code improvement

> ⚠️ This was a learning project — expect rough edges and unrefined code.  
> Completed as part of Boot.dev’s “Build an AI Agent in Python” course.
